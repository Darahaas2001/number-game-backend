# Number Game Backend - Node.js

Welcome to the Number Game Backend, a Node.js application designed to power the backend of the Number Game web application. This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the project effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (for Node.js dependencies)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Darahaas2001/number-game-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
